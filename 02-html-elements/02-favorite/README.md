## What It Demonstrates
This project showcases **volleyball-themed content** using fundamental HTML elements:

### 1. Heading Hierarchy
* **h1**: Main page title ("Volleyball")
* **h2**: Major section headers ("What Is Volleyball", "Volleyball at the Olympic Games", "Main International Volleyball Competitions")

### 2. Text Formatting
* **Bold text** using `<strong>` tag (e.g., "Volleyball", "volley", "The most important international competitions")
* *Italic text* using `<em>` tag (e.g., "volleyball", "Olympic Games program since 1964")
* Underlined text using `<u>` tag (championship names)
* Colored text using `<span>` with inline styles (red text)

### 3. Special Characters
* HTML entities for symbols: ☞ (`&#9758;`) and ☺ (`&#9786;`)

### 4. Semantic Structure
* Proper use of paragraphs `<p>`
* Comments explaining code sections
* Logical content organization about volleyball topic
