        <h2 id="chapter1">What Is Volleyball</h2>
        <p>&#9758; <strong>Volleyball</strong> is a <span style="color: red;">team sport played between two teams&#9786;</span>, 
            each with six players on the court and another six (or sometimes fewer) on the bench. The aim of the game is to score points 
            by making the ball touch the ground in the opponent’s court (attacking phase), and to prevent 
            the opposing team from doing the same (defensive phase). </p> 
        <p>It is also called <strong>“volley”</strong>, an abbreviation of the sport’s name in English, <em>volleyball</em>.</p>
